# An-ML-based-approach-for-solving-inverse-kinematic-of-a-6DOF-robotic-arm
Solving the inverse kinematics of a robotic arm is a necessary step whether it is a first-time installation or the configuration of the robotic arm is already changed. In this work, a machine learning-based approach for solving the inverse kinematic of a robotic arm with six degrees of freedom is presented.
